## Overview

This is small SPA application designed to improve experience of reading LDM (language design meeting) notes in [dotnet/csharplang](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang).

Main goal is to provide read/unread state.

## Features 

* Read C# LDM notes
* Read C# workig group notes
* Tracking of read state (per device)

Not much else, to keep the scope in check â€” if you miss something like "Mark all as read" or similar, please do contribute.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. Please try to follow the current standards and styles. I might tweak things before merging.

## Moving into dotnet/csharplang

If anyone wants to move this directly into dotnet/csharplang, I would be all for that, though tbh in that case prerendered HTML would be a better choice over the current SPA.
